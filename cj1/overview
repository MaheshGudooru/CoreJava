## 💻 The Program
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ JVM Execution Process

### 1. **Compilation (javac)**
- You write the program in a `.java` file (source code).
- The **Java Compiler (`javac`)** translates this source code into **bytecode** (stored in a `.class` file).
- Bytecode is platform-independent instructions understood by the JVM.

👉 Example:
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```
Generates `HelloWorld.class`.

---

### 2. **Class Loader**
- The JVM starts execution by loading the `.class` file into memory.
- The **Class Loader** loads required classes (like `HelloWorld`, `System`, `PrintStream`).
- It ensures classes are loaded only once and manages namespaces.

---

### 3. **Bytecode Verification**
- The **Bytecode Verifier** checks the `.class` file for:
    - Security violations (e.g., illegal memory access).
    - Correctness (e.g., type safety, stack operations).
- Prevents malicious or corrupted code from running.

---

### 4. **JVM Execution Engine**
This is where the magic happens:
- The **Execution Engine** interprets or compiles bytecode into **machine code** for the host OS/CPU.
- Modern JVMs use **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler**:
    - Frequently used code is compiled into native machine code for faster execution.
    - Less-used code may be interpreted.

---

### 5. **Runtime Environment**
- The JVM provides a runtime environment with:
    - **Heap & Stack memory** for objects and method calls.
    - **Garbage Collector** to free unused memory.
    - **Native Libraries** for system-level tasks.

---

### 6. **Program Output**
- The `main` method is executed.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");` calls:
    - `System` → a core class.
    - `out` → a static field (PrintStream object).
    - `println()` → method that prints text to the console.
- Finally, `"Hello, World!"` appears on your screen.

<br/>
The JVM takes your Java code, turns it into a universal language (bytecode), checks it for safety, and then translates it into machine code that your computer understands — finally printing **Hello, World!** on the screen.
